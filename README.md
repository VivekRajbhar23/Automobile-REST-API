The Automobile REST API is a backend web application built using Spring Boot that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing automobile records.
It connects to a MySQL database and exposes RESTful endpoints that allow clients (like React, Angular, or Postman) to interact with automobile data efficiently.
